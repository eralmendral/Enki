# CICD
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- CI - is where developers regularly push code changes into a central repository, and by doing so, automated builds and tests are automatically run.
- Those tests can include **unit tests**, **styling checks**, **linting checks**, **security checks** or any other type of automated test. If any of the tests fail, the build is considered "broken" and the develop is notified so they can fix it.
