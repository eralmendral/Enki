### Images
- docker tag
- docker images
- docker image inspect
- docker rmi
- docker prune


### Containers 
- docker ps
- docker rm


### Stopping and Restarting Containers
- docker stop <container> -> 
- docker start -> if image did not change, we don't need to re build container
- docker run -> creates a new container based on an image

### Attached and Detached Containers
- Attached mode -> can see logs 
- Detached mode -> docker run -d  - detached mode, cannot see logs 
- Re attach -> docker attach <container_name>
- By default, if you run a Container without -d, you run in "attached mode".
- If you started a container in detached mode (i.e. with -d), you can still attach to it afterwards without restarting the Container with the following command:
docker attach CONTAINER
attaches you to a running Container with an ID or name of CONTAINER.


### Logs
- docker logs <container>
