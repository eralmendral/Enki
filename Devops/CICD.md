## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is where developers regularly push code changes into a central repository, and by doing so, automated builds and tests are automatically run.

Those tests can include unit tests, integration tests, styling checks, linting checks, security checks or any other type of automated test. If any of the tests fail, the build is considered "broken" and the developer is notified so they can fix it
