# Trees

- are widely used data structure that simulate a hierarchical tree structure.
- the root node is at the top, and the 'leaves' are at the bottom.
- multiple nodes in a tree can have the same value.
- Parent nodes can have multiple children, and children can have one parent.


# Binary Trees
- trees aren't particularty useful data structures unless they're ordered in some way. One of the most common types of ordered tree is a Binary Search Tree or **BST**. A BST has some additional constraints:
1. Instead of an unbounded list of children, each node has at most 2 children.
2. The left child's value must be less than it's parent's vale
3. The right child's value must be greater than it's parent's value.
4. No two nodes in the BST can have the same value.
