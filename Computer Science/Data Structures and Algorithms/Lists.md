### Lists
- Append - appending an element to the end of the list. **O(1)**
- Index - accessing an element by index.  **O(1)**
- Delete - removing an element from the middle of the list. **O(n)**
- Search - searching for an element in the list. We have to iterate over the list until we find the element. **O(n)**

> In other words, lists start to struggle in two primary areas:
1. When you need to frequently delete elements from the middle of the list
2. When you need to frequently search for specific elements in the entire list
