**Summary of 'Dive Into Design Patterns'**

**1. Introduction to OOP**
- **Basics of OOP**: Defines objects and classes, explaining attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
- **Pillars of OOP**: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- **Relations Between Objects**: Dependency, Association, Aggregation, and Composition.

**2. Introduction to Design Patterns**
- **What is a Design Pattern?**: Common solutions to recurring problems in software design.
- **Why Learn Patterns?**: Improves code reuse, maintainability, and communication among developers.
- **Classification**:
  - Creational Patterns: Object creation mechanisms.
  - Structural Patterns: Composition of classes/objects.
  - Behavioral Patterns: Communication and responsibility delegation.

**3. Software Design Principles**
- **Encapsulate What Varies**: Isolate changing parts of a program to minimize impact.
- **Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation**: Depend on abstractions for flexibility.
- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: Reduce code coupling.
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility Principle: One reason to change per class.
  - Open/Closed Principle: Extend without modifying existing code.
  - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be replaceable without breaking functionality.
  - Interface Segregation Principle: Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on unused methods.
  - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules shouldnâ€™t depend on low-level modules.

**4. Catalog of Design Patterns**
- **Creational Patterns**:
  - Factory Method: Interface for creating objects, with subclasses defining the exact type.
  - Abstract Factory: Produces families of related objects.
  - Builder: Constructs complex objects step-by-step.
  - Prototype: Clones existing objects.
  - Singleton: Ensures a single instance of a class.

- **Structural Patterns**:
  - Adapter: Converts interface of a class into another expected by a client.
  - Bridge: Separates abstraction from implementation.
  - Composite: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
  - Decorator: Adds behavior dynamically.
  - Facade: Simplifies interactions with complex systems.
  - Flyweight: Minimizes memory usage through object sharing.
  - Proxy: Controls access to objects.

- **Behavioral Patterns**:
  - Chain of Responsibility: Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
  - Command: Encapsulates requests as objects.
  - Iterator: Provides a way to access elements sequentially.
  - Mediator: Centralizes complex communication between objects.
  - Memento: Captures an object's state for restoration.
  - Observer: Defines dependency between objects.
  - State: Allows object behavior to change dynamically.
  - Strategy: Selects behavior at runtime.
  - Template Method: Defines a skeleton of an algorithm.
  - Visitor: Allows adding new operations without modifying objects.

**5. Conclusion**
- Design patterns help create flexible, reusable, and maintainable software.
- Applying patterns depends on specific use cases and problem domains.
