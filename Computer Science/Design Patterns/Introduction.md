### What's a Design Pattern?
 - Typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
 - They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve recurring design problem in your code.
 - The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
 - You can follow the pattern details for your programs.


### Pattern vs Algorithm
 - Both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems.
 - Algorithm - always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal.
 - Pattern - is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.


### Analogy
 - Algorithm is a cooking recipe.
 - Pattern is  more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.


### What does pattern consists of?
 - Intent  - describes both the problem and the solution
 - Motivation - further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
 - Structure - classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.


### Classification of Patterns
 - Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed.
 - **Idioms** - most basic and low-level patterns. Usually apply only to a single programming language.
 - The most universal patterns are **Architectural Patterns**. Developers can implement these patterns in any language.


### Three main groups of patterns:
 1. Creational Patterns - provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
 2. Structural Patterns - explain how to assemble objects and classes into larget structures, while keeping these structures flexibile and efficient.
 3. Behavioral Patterns - take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
