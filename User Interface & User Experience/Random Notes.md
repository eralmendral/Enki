## Persona
 
- Why do we have a persona?
- It's to allow us to be specific
- It helps me distance myself, otherwise I end up building things that I would like based on my own history and the way I know the product.
- This gives me boundaries otherwise we end up designing for ourself or everybody and then noboby wins.
- Help with dealing with client/stakeholders as well, you can detach your own personal preferences. ( I want brushscript, they want Times New Roman )
- What the designer like, what the client like?

- What right for the customer?

- Color, Fonts, Language, Types of Imagery, Organization of Information, What features should be shown?
- Preferences he/she have?
