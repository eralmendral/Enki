## AI Agents

### Generative AI vs Agentic AI
- Generative AI
   - examples are 'ChatGPT, MidJourney and similar tools'
   - creative assistant
   - Generate text, images, code based on your prompt

 - Agentic AI
   - acts like a proactive colleague
   - can set their own goals, make autonomous decisions, take actions without constant human guidance.
     


## Generative AI responds to requests, Agentic AI initiates actions to achieve objectives.
> Generative AI - you're mostly concerned  about the quality and appropriateness of it's outputs.
> Agentic AI - you need to think about the boundaries of it's decision making authority and how to ensure it acts within acceptable constraints.

Example:
1. A generative AI can write an email when you ask it to.
2. An agentic AI might monitor your calendar, notice that you're running late for meeting and automatically draft and send an email to attendees all without being prompted.

### AI
 - Brain Power

### AI Agent
- Do the action
1. Understand - (input)
2. Think  - (process)
3. Act - (output)
 

### Two Components
 1. Interacting with the agent (chat, voice, click butttons)  -> User Interface in the Frontend
 2. Workflow  -> Backend





### Levels 
1. LLM - input -> process -> output (ex. ChatGPT)
2. AI Workflows -> input -> process -> retrieve to other resource -> output
4. AI Agents -> REASONING -> ACT(via tools) -> ITERATE
