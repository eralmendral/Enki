## Automation

1. Write down your entire process, like you're teaching someone how to do your job. (Including thought processes and creative processes)
2. Assume that any task or piece of that process can be done with a prompt.
3. Attempt to turn that task or piece that process to a prompt.
4. Test it, note where it doesn't do well, and refine the prompt until it's at least 90% of the way there.
