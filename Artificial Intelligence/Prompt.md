### **Tactic 2**: Ask for a structured output
### **Tactic 3**: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

### **Tactic 4**: "Few-shot" prompting
- a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that allows models to perform tasks with minimal examples. Instead of needing large amounts of data for training, it guides the model with a few examples within the prompt itself. 


## Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
