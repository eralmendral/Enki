## Testing

> Rethink the 'supposed to's in testing with 'How to Test Almost Anything.' Focus on crafting systems and experiences that delight both users and our business (hint: they should be the same thing!). Challenge standard practices and lean into a user-centric approach to develop systems that are robust, maintainable, and truly resonate with user needs, propelling your business forward.


# Manual vs. Automated Testing (Summary)

## ðŸ§ª Manual Testing
- Performed by a human interacting with the software (e.g., clicking, typing).
- Useful for **exploratory testing**.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Time-consuming and expensive.
  - Prone to human errors (e.g., typos, skipped steps).

## ðŸ¤– Automated Testing
- Performed by machines using **pre-written test scripts**.
- Can test simple functions or full user flows.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast, reliable, and scalable.
  - Ideal for **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**.
- **Limitations**:
  - Only as good as the scripts you write.

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practice
- Use **automated testing** for repeatable, scalable checks.
- Combine with **manual exploratory testing** for unpredictable issues and UI behavior.
