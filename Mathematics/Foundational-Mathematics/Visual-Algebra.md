## Build patterns and sequences to start seeing algebra in a new light.


# Patterns
 - Math is a tool to describe patterns.

 - Explore linear, quadratic, and other patterns and sequences.


### Pattern Rules
 - A **rule** say how a pattern grows. Let's use rules to make predictions.
 
### Linear Patterns
 - Patterns that grow by the same amount on each step.
 
### Growing Patterns
 - More complicated linear pattern.
 - This linear pattern grows by adding a single unit in different places.
